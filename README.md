# Active Directory PowerShell.

Repository of MS Active Directory related cmdlets and scriplets.

The examples presented in the repo are more for reference than for educational purpose, which is why you won't see anything being explained how and why something works the way it does. For that I recommend referencing MS Docs or other similar materials.

Also, the examples are **a** way how to do things, not **the** way. Modify cmdlets and scripts to suit your particular needs.
